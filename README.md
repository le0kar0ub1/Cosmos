# Cosmos

Another birth of a x86_64 kernel named COSmOS (yeah, word count double).

## Dependencies

  * `make` (dev under v4.3)
  * `grub-mkrescue` (dev under v2.04)
  * `mtools` (GNU mtools) (dev under 4.0.24)
  * `libisoburn`

## Install

Cosmos use his own cross-compiler with frozen version, build it by executing the following command-line.
The dependencies are also checked-up.

`./mktoolchain/mktoolchain`

## Build

The only arch-target of Cosmos is x64, then the keyword `TARGET` is used here to control the build.

| Target     | Effect                 |
|------------|------------------------|
| debug      | build kernel for debug |
| release    | build kernel release   |

Inspired from cargo (and others) philosophy.

Defaulting to *debug*.

### Kernel build

`make kernel [TARGET=$Target]`

output: `elf` file.

### ISO build

`make [iso] [TARGET=$Target]`

output: `iso` file.

## Run

A configured *QEMU* run is provided.

`make run`
